# ECM2418-ComputerLanguagesAndRepresentations

Continuous.pdf describes the coursework questions I was presented with.
The coursework was based around prolog and haskell to learn paradigms in functional and logical programming.

My solutions are put in individual files which refer to specific questions as follow:

Party.hs       ->    Question 1
Bilateral.hs   ->    Question 2
Suko.pl        ->    Question 3
Trait.pl       ->    Question 4
